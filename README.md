# theming-test-page

Use the two files in this repo to create a theming test page like we did on [Live Coding Happy Hour at 08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KDrbJK25FA&t=530s). 

The rough steps are:

1. Create a new page.

1. With your new page open in UI Builder, go to Menu > Developer > Open Page Definition.

1. Paste the text from the Composition file into the Composition field and the text from the Layout model file into the Layout model field.

1. Refresh UI Builder and you should have a page with many components on it.
